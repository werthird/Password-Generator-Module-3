# Password Generator

UCF Module 03 Challenge - Javascript Password Generator

## Description

The goal of this project was to code a JavaScript function to generate a random password based upon the users preferences.

UCF GitLab starter code was provided. This included the HTML, CSS, Assets folder, and JavaScript file. The JavaScript file contained all the code to run the Password Generator Function, but didn't include the actual function.

## Getting Started

### User Story
```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```


### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Notes
Included in the repository for this challenge is another folder call **another_solution**. This includes another way for the Password Generator Function to run, using strings instead of arrays. It was the first solution that worked for me. I decided I wanted to build the function based more on what we have learned in the class so far, so I rewrote the function to use arrays to store the password characters, not strings. It was left in this repo to save for future reference. Please ignore if not applicaple to the grade of this project.
